<p>SUMMARY OF QUALIFICATIONS<p>
I have 4.5 years of experience as a real estate agent with multiple brokerages, resulting in diverse experience. Additionally, I have substantial, varied customer service, sales and construction experience beyond real estate. I am fantastic at building professional relationships and creating loyal customers who refer others to work with me. The culmination of all of my unique experience provides me with knowledge in not only real estate but business relationships, and customer service.  I believe my experiences make me a great asset to any team.
